# Using Programming by Example to extract relevant information from build logs

Master Thesis Topic Proposal

## Problem Description

Buildlogs from CI are often very long, at best semi-structured and have a high inter-variability, which makes it hard for developers to extract relevant information. Such relevant information could be test results, static analysis warnings, the duration of build steps ore resource consumption.
In existing approaches the bulidlogs are analyzed by simple templates or regular expressions, with are both complicated to create, maintain and extend.

### Problem Source / Motivation

Heavily influenced by Moritz' research proposal, literature references to be found there.

## Solution Sketch

**Build a system which enables developers to extract non-predefined build and test information from semi-structured buildlog files in a language and build system-agnostic way**

*All the proposed options here will spark a wish to discuss in you - let's postpone that to after the topic was selected (if it will be) ðŸ™‚*

+ **build a system** This could be a webpage enabling the following workflow:
  + A user posts his buildlog  (**language and build system-agnostic**)
    + upload file *or*
    + paste string *or*
    + import from travis / other online build platform
  + The user creates a query for the information he desires (**non-predefined build and test information**)
    + by writing his own examples
      + text input based *or*
      + selecting text from the user-provided log
    + by selecting a preset
      + created by us for common bulid systems & use cases *or*
      + created & saved by the user in an earlier session *or*
      + created & saved by other users
  + The system presents to the user with its findings
  + The user can then refine his query based on the findings
    + by addding new examples *or*
    + by selecting false positives *or*
    + selecting from proposed examples that distinguish different possible approaches generated by the PBE tool *or*
    + altering the code generated by the PBE tool

+ Implementation: use common web language/tool/framework (which one?), Microsoft Prose API for generating code from examples

+ Evaluation: study,  
Task: extract information xy from this bulidlog,  
Comparsion: old approach (strg+F searching, regexes) & new one (PBE) (prebuild example sets might need to be excluded here),  
Measure: time (quantitative evaluation),  
Afterwards: interview on impressions (qualitative evaluation),  
Comments: combination of personal & online study possible

### Existing work which might be useful for solution

+ TravisTorrent
+ Microsoft Prose
+ Ideas from / evaluation against: Logstash, GHTorrent

## Discussion

### Machine Learning instead of PBE

+ I have not a lot of background in machine learning â†’ would lead to a lot more supervising effort

### Scope

#### pro Scope

+ Many options / possible additions in the solution proposals

#### con Scope

+ To be discussed: which conference deadline is feasible for this project?
+ How much can the implementation of the webpage be based on existing systems? (we should make sure to focus on the research-interesting parts and not use too much time to develop a webpage)

### Feasibility & Competence

+ Supervision:
  + Would Anand like to supervise this topic?
  + How close supervision by Moritz can we do / do we want to do?
  + Are there other members of the Delft group (maybe more) experienced in the fields touche by this topic?

#### pro Feasibility & Competence

+ Well worked out proposal
+ Work extends & combines existing technologies (TravisTorrent, Microsoft PROSE)

#### con Feasibility & Competence

+ Medium prior experience with web-dev

### Research-Relevance

#### pro Research-Relevance

+ Language and build system-agnostic
+ Results in interesting future work:
  + Extend platform with all the features not implemented
  + Extend platform with machine learning approach & evaluate against each other
  + Predictive continious integration

#### con Research-Relevance

### Personal Preference

#### pro Personal Preference

+ I find program synthesis an interesting field ðŸ˜Š
+ When thinking about the realization of this project I have a kind of clear process in mind

#### con Personal Preference

+ Web-development (â†’ keep as small as possible, mostly uninteresting to research part anyway)
+ Would need to reask my munich professors / probably search for a new supervisor (should not be difficult)
