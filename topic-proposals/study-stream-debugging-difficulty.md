# Are Java streams really harder to debug than traditional code?

Master Thesis Topic Proposal

## Problem Description

It is a widespread belief that Java Streams are hard to debug. However this was not yet shown by research (**TODO** really? check for existing studies).

### Problem Source / Motivation

Well-written stream/lambda code, which means each stream operation & each lambda gets a separate source code line, might provide enough tracability between stacktraces & code.

## Solution Sketch

+ Design & Execute Study (several ones?: online quantitative & offline + interviews qualitative)

### Existing work which might be useful for solution
